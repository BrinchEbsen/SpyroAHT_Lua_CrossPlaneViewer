# Spyro: A Hero's Tail - Load Trigger (CrossPlane) Viewer Script for BizHawk
Aims to display the CrossPlane triggers in real-time in the level, as well as giving helpful text and additional graphics.
Only works for NTSC. Made for CasualPokePlayer's branch of BizHawk that supports the Dolphin core: https://tasvideos.org/Forum/Topics/23347.

Put the `CrossPlanes.lua` script and the `Packages` folder into BizHawk's `Lua` folder, and run `CrossPlanes.lua` through the Lua console to start it up.<br>
An additional window will pop up with checkboxes for displaying certain elements.
